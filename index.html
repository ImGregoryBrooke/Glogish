      <header class=header>Welcome to Glog!<header>

      <p class=description>You are probably wondering what on mother Earth a glog is. To put it simply, a glog is my geeky blog. WAIT! Before you leave at least give it a chance.
	  I will pretty much be writing about whatever I want to in my geeky life. I may rant occasionally, but I will try to provide plenty of warning. Hopefully this site will
	  improve over time to become more visually appealing and interesting. Maybe have a comments section for advice if I can figure out how to code it. Well, for now enjoy.<br>
