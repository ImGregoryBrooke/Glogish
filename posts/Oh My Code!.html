    <p>I'd like to say that I completely flew through the coding of this blogging site, but to tell you the truth I have struggled.
	Struggled long and hard like poor Frodo Baggins in Tolkien's <em>Lord of The Rings</em>. Of course, coding is an enjoyable past-time.
	Just not for somebody who has a life, unless they're getting paid for it. (If you are thinking that I might be getting paid let me
    assure you that I wish I was at that level. haha...). So this first post is mostly for experimentation and to just say that all of those
    people out there that do this for a living are incredible. Coding things like this without using some premade template is a ton of work. 
I have a lot of respect for those people, and I only developed it after trying myself.</p>
    <p>Now might also be a good time to explain this blog a little better for anybody who cares. I wanted to experiment and try out the coding
	that I learned from Codecademy. I also like to talk even if it is one-sided. So welcome to the conversation were all you have to do is listen
	until you no longer want to. I have no way currently to receive feedback, but I plan on figuring that out eventually. The topics that I might 
	talk about throughout this blog includes, but isn't limited to school, technology, literature, religion, and whatever else catches my attention.
	Have a good one.
